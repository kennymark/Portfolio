            Iâ€™m Kenny Mark, currently a Software Engineer for SABS Travel Technologies. I am front-end focused developer with full stack experience. With a total of 5 years of experience, 3 years freelancing,studying and building hobby projects and 2 years commercial I have worked on every kind of application be it small, medium or very large enterprise application.

            </span>. Software development aside, I am also heavily invested in the creation and nurturing of ideas that are used by the masses. I incline to be entrepreneurial at times and product design would be an area I would love to explore and competent at. I see beyond code and design.
