          Iâ€™m Kenny Mark, currently a Software Engineer for SABS Travel Technologies. I am front-end focused with full stack experience. With a total of 5 years of experience, 3 years freelancing,studying and building hobby projects and 2 years commercial I have worked every kind of application be it small, medium or very large enterprise code base. I love everything UI design and UX on the web but I have  also worked on developed mobile applications, web apps and some backend applications.

        <p className='text-xl mt-2 text-gray-600 leading-snug'>
          I actively spend many hours per day working on my side projects which can be found on github. Software development aside, I am also heavily invested in the creation and nurturing of ideas that are used by the masses. I incline to be entrepreneurial at times and product design would be an area I would love to explore and competent at. I see beyond code and design.
