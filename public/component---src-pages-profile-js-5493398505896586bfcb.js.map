I graduated with a Computer Science degree in CompSci but the web (front-end & backend) is where I live. I love everything about UI design and UX on the web. I have worked on several projects including this website. I also develop and design mobile apps with React Native.\n\n          </p>\n          <p className='text-xl mt-2 text-gray-600 leading-snug'>\n            I actively spend many hours per day working on my side projects which can be found on github code. I have developed applications for mobile, desktop and web both in their native languages or using cross-platform solutions. Software development aside, I am also heavily invested in the creation and nurturing of ideas that are used by the masses. I incline to be entrepreneurial at times and product design would be an area I would love to explore and competent at. I see beyond code and design.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div id=\"portfolio \" className='flex-1  rounded-lg h-64 w-full '>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
